# Welcome to Android Digital Frame! üéâ

![App Icon](icon-192.png)

I'm thrilled you're exploring our Open Source app designed to breathe new life into your old Android devices by transforming them into digital frames. 
Our commitment to Open Source means you get a product built on transparency, community-driven enhancements, and trust.

I've started this project out of a personal need for a privacy-respecting digital frame app. It's built with zero tracking and no unnecessary sales pitches  - just a straightforward, useful app.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started, you can download the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pedronveloso.androiddigitalframe) or build it yourself from the source code.

Alternatively, you can download the APK directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/pedronveloso/android-digital-frame/releases) page.

### Building the app

To build the app, you'll need to have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed. Once you have it, you can clone the repository and open it in Android Studio.
The project doesn't require any special setup, so you should be able to build and run it right away. 

## Features üç∞

 - **Privacy-focused**: No tracking, no ads, no unnecessary permissions.
 - **Background photos**: You can pick the photos you want to display on your digital frame. The photos will be displayed in a random order using transition animations.
 - **Orientation support**: You can use the app in portrait or landscape mode.
 - **Date & Time**: You can display the current date and time on the screen.
 - **Weather**: You can display the current weather on the screen.
 - **Countdown message**: You can display an optional countdown message on the screen for events that are meaningful to you.
 - **Made for AMOLED screens**: The uses animations, text relocation and HUD transparency to reduce the risk of screen burn-in. This happens by default, and is especially important for preserving AMOLED screens.
 - **Always on display**: The app can be used as an always-on display.

‚û°Ô∏è With time, I plan to add more features to the app. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
